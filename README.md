# OpenMemer

A simple, free, open-source meme generator with no watermarks, no ads, lightweight and fully client-side.

[Make your own meme here](https://openmemer.com/)


## Features

- Classic Impact-style meme text (white fill, black stroke)
- Top and bottom captions with live preview
- Multiline wrapping for long captions
- Export as PNG — completely client-side
- No accounts, no ads, no bullshit

## To-Do list
This is stuff I have to do in order to get the minimum viable product done.
- [X] Mobile layout
- [ ] Mobile layout that isn't horrible
- [ ] GIF / animated caption support
- [ ] Demotivational poster mode
- [ ] Drag-to-position text
- [ ] Drag 'n drop mode

## Stretch Goals
I want OpenMemer to become the ultimate shitposting suite.
For that to be accomplished, I want to add the following:
### Audio support
- [ ] Low quality sound (low bitrate converter)
- [ ] "Earrape" audio (distortion/amplification)
- [ ] Regular pitch shifts
- [ ] "Griffin method" (Capcut's "Beat" feature, where you can pitch shift with keyframes. Probably won't be able to implement this)
### Image editing
- [ ] Low quality/bitcrusher
- [ ] Deepfry
- [ ] Filters?
- [ ] Stickers
- [ ] Meme formats that are updated regularly.
- [ ] Blur effects

Maybe eventually, video support can also get added.
This is definitely not planned, but could potentially come in the future.
